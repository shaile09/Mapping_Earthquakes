# Earthquakes Challenge 

In this challenge, to illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates, we used GitHub to access the tectonic plate data from this GitHub repository. We added a third map style as an additional tile layer. We also needed to make an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then added the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, we created a a third map style of your choosing. Map styles were added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible. We added tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

Objectives of this module were:
1) Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
2) Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
3) Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
4) Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.

Once we completd the objectives, Basil and Sadhana would like to saw the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the Earth. They can also see the third map.
